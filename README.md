AccessiDys
==========
AccessiDys makes documents, books and web pages easier to read. It’s aimed at people with disabilities or anyone who has difficulty reading long or complex documents. From students or pupils with dyslexia or the elderly with impaired vision to the executive in a hurry, AccessiDys facilitates the understanding of administrative or legal documents, traditional textbooks, magazines or newspapers with complex layout, small fonts, or lacking speech synthesis.

AccessiDys is a web platform with two main features : 
* **A personalized reading experience**: Web pages and documents are accessed via a bespoke reading profile with a wide range of settings adapted to the individual needs of each reader. Aimed at those with limited time or attention spans, with dyslexia, dyspraxia, autism or visual deficiencies, AccessiDys can also read pages aloud.
* **Document transformer**: Make your document or page accessible to readers by quickly and easily importing and transforming any type of document format. Be it a scanned PDF file, an Office document, an ePub ebook or a traditional web page, AccessiDys will let you transform it so that readers will enjoy a fully personalized reading experience.

Imagine a world with accessible web pages
--------------------
When Myriam was 10 years old she had great difficulty reading. In the classroom, when she had to read, she would quickly get tired and had to make a great effort to concentrate, making her exhausted, demotivating her and hampering her learning. Despite this, she was just as intelligent as the other children. Luckily, Myriam was able to avoid academic failure due to extraordinary support from her mother, who often spent up to 3 hours a day adapting her daughter’s homework using photocopies, collages, coloring and underlining.

Today Myriam is herself a mother. Just like her, Adam her son, suffers from severe Dyslexia. But Adam has no difficulty at school because the work given to him by his teachers appears on his tablet in a format that suits him: large font types, quadruple spacing between each line, color coding and synthesized text to voice. He is even able to reread while he is writing. To achieve this, Adam, together with his Teacher, his Speech Therapist and his Occupational Therapist is using AccessiDys, the free online service that adapts documents to individual needs. What Adam enjoys most is being able to browse the Internet and access content that is automatically  adapted to his needs,  in just one click.

Every year in France, 240 000 severely dyslexic children like Adam go to school (based on INSERM assessment, 2007). Among every class of 11 year olds there are around 5 pupils who have low level reading skills (OECD PISA survey, 2012). Globally, around 100 million children suffer specific cognitive difficulties (Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysphasia…). The world’s adult population is also concerned (you remain Dyslexic all your life): around 140 million people suffer from severe Dyslexia (2% of the world’s population).  Moreover, 250 million immigrants (World Bank, 2016) have to learn a new language and 850 million adults are touched by illiteracy (UNESCO, 2015). All these people have to overcome serious obstacles to be able to read, inhibiting their access to learning, culture and a real place in society. Badly adapted documents and contents effectively put these populations in the position of being handicapped.

Prepare or create accessible documents

* Type and edit any document with the help of a state-of-the-art web text editor
* Import a large number of web page by copying and pasting its URL or its content
* Import a large number of web page by setting a “bookmarklet” in your web browser and clicking on it from the web page to be imported
* Import any office document (LibreOffice documents preferred) with a copy and paste of its content
* Import scanned (PDF or image) documents : visually slice the scanned document into meaningful blocks and automatically extract text from these blocks (fairly accurate embedded optical character recognition straight from the web editor),
* Edit the logical outline of the imported document (level-1 title, level-2 title, plain paragraph, …) so that it becomes more accessible and browsable with or without assistive technologies
* Type textual alternatives for meaningful images included in the document so that they become accessible to readers with visual or cognitive deficiencies
* Share accessible documents by email or on your favorite social network (be cautious and only share documents you are allowed to modify and share)
